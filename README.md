# PenQuill - A Simple Notepad Clone in C++
PenQuill is a simple Notepad clone created in C++ and WinForms. This is meant to emulate Windows Notepad's more advanced saving and opening file systems. 

This includes:
- The application taking note of whenever the user had inputted new text and if it needs to be saved.
- The application's title changing depending on the filename and path.
- Error handlers and save dialogs

This will be missing the Edit section in the header, mainly because the textbox already has copy, cut, paste, etc. functionality. It had felt like a waste to add something like that in the name of exact similarity.
